**💼 Ad-hoc-Analysis-AtliQ-Hardwares**

**🧠 Problem Statement**

AtliQ Hardwares is a computer hardware manufacturing company that sells products globally through various channels like Amazon, Croma, and Best Buy. AtliQ Hardwares,relied completely on Excel to manage its growing business. As sales and revenue increased, their Excel files became larger and harder to handle — until one day, their key business planning file crashed beyond recovery.

To fix this, AtliQ built a proper *MySQL database* That’s when they brought in a *data analytics team* to make the company truly *data-informed* by solving ad-hoc business problems with SQL. The *Product Owner* often requests data insights and business reports to support decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

Currently, the data team receives *multiple ad-hoc analysis requests* from stakeholders to help them understand sales trends, market performance, product demand, and forecast accuracy.

The goal of this project is to create a *centralized SQL-based solution* to quickly respond to these business questions using *views, joins, and stored procedures*.

---

**🎯 Objective**

The main objective of this project is to:

- Perform *ad-hoc business analysis* using SQL.
- Automate repetitive analysis by creating *stored procedures*.
- Build *reusable queries* to generate quick reports for different business needs.
- Help the product owner make *data-driven decisions* for product, market, and customer strategy.

**🧾 Ad Hoc Request 7 — Forecast Accuracy for All Customers**

**📄 Problem Statement**

As a product owner, I need an **aggregate forecast accuracy report** for all customers for a given **fiscal year**, so that I can track how accurate our forecasts are compared to actual sales.

The report includes the following fields:

1. Customer Code, Name, Market
2. Total Sold Quantity
3. Total Forecast Quantity
4. Net Error
5. Absolute Error
6. Forecast Accuracy %

---

**⚙️ Data Preparation**

To achieve this, I first created a new table called **`fact_act_est`** by combining both **`fact_sales_monthly`** and **`fact_forecast_monthly`** tables.

- I used **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** to ensure we include customers who had *sales but no forecast* and *forecast but no sales*.
- This ensures **no data is missed**.
- Then, I updated all **NULL values to 0**, as instructed by the product owner.
